    <h1>Lecture 5: Git good at git and be sad at a Zen Garden</h1>
    <p>Lecture 5 went heavily into git, how to properly branch code and correctly do the ACP process. It seemed pretty straight forward, though that
        is what I thought last week before I somehow incorrectly cloned down something and created a duplicate. We also were shown Stack Overflow
        which I was already familiar with but also this amazing site called CSS Zen Garden. It was a little depressing to see CSS magic that I don't think
        I'll ever come close to. That being said, the artistic side of things were never my strong suit nor was it a driving factor for me choosing this class.
