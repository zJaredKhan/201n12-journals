    <h1> Lecture 2 : The about me</h1>

    <p>The about me - this is the first time in a good 15 that I really got my hands dirty with HTML again. Honestly the basics came back to me pretty quickly
        but the ACP (add, commit, push) process was a bit foreign to me. I feel like I was making progress on the lab (as the instruction was going on).
    </p>
    <p> I'm feeling oddly confident so far in my abilities, I realize the class has just started but so far nothing is confusing me or going too fast for me. Here's to hoping it stays that way!
        I've decided to try my hand a little at CSS as I've never done it before. I managed to set a background color, link a picture of myself and get it centered.
