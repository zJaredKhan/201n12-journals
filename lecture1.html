    <h1> The first Class!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>My first class was a bit of a whirlwind but not as bad as I thought. Before the first day of class I originally intended on dual booting my system with 
    Win 10 and Ubuntu. I ended up blowing away Windows and going just straight Ubuntu, this is because I quickly found troubleshoot issues in a dual boot environment
    was a pain in the butt. So far no regrets.
    </p>
    <p>I found that my system setup was good so far, I didn't run into any issues following the instructions to get set up. It was nice to meet the instructor
        and a few of my fellow students.
