    <h1>Lecture 4: functions and CSS boxes</h1>
    <p>My slight over confidence expressed after the first couple lectures is now gone. I played quite a bit with functions in my About Me project. I 
        eventually got them to work correctly but it didn't really come easy. We got into a bit of basic CSS design, boxes, outlines, floating stuff etc.
        I eventually got everything to work as I wanted but my "experiments" seemed like I was just throwing everything at it, seeing what stuck and then clean it up.
        Not so much scientific method and more guess and check repeatedly over and over and over again to get everything to line up correctly.
